Based on the balance of structural carry, commodity-driven CAD strength and still-intact shorter-term uptrend versus the longer-term 200-day caution, I agree with the desk’s tactical bull lean—but with strict discipline around risk controls:

1. Trade Setup  
   • Entry: 104.50–105.00 zone (preferably limit order on a pullback to the rising 50-day SMA)  
   • Size: 1 % portfolio NAV per 100-pip stop  
   • Stop-loss: 103.45–103.50 (daily close below 103.50 invalidates the bull flag)  
   • Targets:  
      – TP1 at 106.60 (200-day SMA) – move stop to breakeven on first hit  
      – TP2 at 107.80 (April channel high)  
   • Time frame: 4–8 weeks; reassess around the July 5 BoC meeting and mid-July Fed commentary  

2. Risk Controls & Lessons Applied  
   • Volatility filter: If ATR >1.6 JPY, tighten stops to 0.8 ATR  
   • News blackout: Flat or half size 24 hours before key U.S. payrolls or BoJ/YCC announcements  
   • Cross-hedge: Small long-dated USD/JPY put to soften a flash JPY-rally drawdown  
   • No chase: Enter only on retracement to the 50-day; discipline over FOMO  

3. Contingency  
   • Close on a daily close below 103.50  
   • Flip short only on a dovish BoC pivot signal + oil < $72 underpinning  

By patiently waiting for a dip to 104.50–105.00, risking ~100 pips to target 160–300 pips with positive carry, this trade offers an attractive asymmetric profile. FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
