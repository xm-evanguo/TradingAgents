Detailed Trend Analysis for CADJPY=X (2025-06-01 to 2025-06-30):

Overall Price Action
• June saw CADJPY rally from the low-104s up into the mid-106s, a ~2% move on the month.  
• The advance encountered resistance near 106.85–107.00, with late-month retrenchment back toward 105.60.

Short-Term Momentum (10 EMA vs. Price)
• As of 6/30, the 10 EMA sits at 105.83 vs. a close of 105.61, indicating the immediate shift to slight short-term bearishness.  
• The 10‐period EMA peaked at ~105.95 on 6/24, tracking CADJPY’s high-volatility peaks, but has been rolling over since.

Medium-Term Trend (50 SMA vs. Price)
• The 50 SMA is steadily rising, from ~103.99 on 5/26 to ~104.69 on 6/30, confirming a medium-term uptrend.  
• CADJPY remains comfortably above its 50 SMA (105.61 vs. 104.69) – a sign that the pullback is within a broader uptrend.

Long-Term Trend (200 SMA vs. Price)
• The 200 SMA hovers around 106.56, slightly declining from 106.61 at month-start, reflecting a slow long-term downtrend.  
• Price sits below the 200 SMA, indicating the pair has yet to reverse its dominant long-term bearish bias.

Momentum Oscillators (MACD & Histogram)
• The MACD line rose to a high of ~0.526 on 6/24 before rolling over to ~0.359 by month-end, signaling waning bullish momentum.  
• The MACD histogram turned negative on 6/27 (–0.036) and deepened to –0.067 by 6/30, foreshadowing a short-term bearish crossover.

RSI (14-day)
• RSI peaked at ~62 on 6/17, then slid to ~51.7 on 6/30.  
• No overbought extremes (never above 70), but the pattern shows lower highs in RSI vs. higher price highs—a mild bearish divergence.

Volatility (ATR)
• ATR climbed from ~1.10 at the start of June to ~1.15 on 6/06, denoting heightened volatility mid-month.  
• It then eased back to ~0.95 by 6/30 as the market consolidated.

Bollinger Upper Band (20, 2σ)
• The upper band widened to ~107.00 around 6/26 then contracted as price pulled back.  
• CADJPY traded within the band for most of June, confirming no decisive breakout but respecting expected volatility boundaries.

Trading Implication
• Medium-term uptrend remains intact (price > 50 SMA) but the lack of a break above the 200 SMA and negative short-term momentum signals argue for caution.  
• Traders may look for a pullback close to the 50 SMA (~104.50–105.00) as a higher-probability entry in line with the uptrend, with stops informed by ATR (~1.0 yen).  
• On the upside, a sustained break and close above 106.60–106.85 (200 SMA and recent highs) would confirm a bullish shift in the long-term trend.
