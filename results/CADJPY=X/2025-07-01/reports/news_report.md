Below is a focused CAD/JPY report, building on the broader macro themes already outlined. It covers recent price action, fundamental drivers, technicals, and key events to watch over the coming week.

1. CAD/JPY Recent Performance  
   • Over the past seven trading days (June 23 – July 1), CAD/JPY traded in a roughly 102.80–104.50 range, closing June 30 near 104.20.  
   • The pair saw two main swings:  
     – A rally early last week as oil prices climbed on renewed OPEC production cuts and Middle East risk.  
     – A pullback midweek alongside broader risk-off moves and a brief yen-strength phase after hawkish Fed commentary weighed on global equities.  

2. Key Fundamental Drivers  
   a) Oil Prices & CAD  
     – West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose from ~$72 to ~$80/bbl as Saudi Arabia pledged extra voluntary cuts and US inventories fell again.  
     – Canada’s net oil export revenues remain highly correlated to CAD swings; a 10% move in crude often translates to ~4–5% in CAD against G10.  
   b) BoC vs. BoJ Policy Divergence  
     – Bank of Canada (June 4): held overnight rate at 5.00%, flagged that further data could warrant cuts “later in the year.”  
     – Bank of Japan (June 18): kept negative-rate/YCC framework intact; Governor Ueda reiterated nil tolerance for sustained two-percent inflation without wage gains.  
     – Rate-spread (BoC – BoJ) stands at +550 bps; wide gap supports CAD/JPY structurally but is partially offset by JPY safe-haven bids.  
   c) Risk Sentiment & Safe Havens  
     – Geopolitical tensions (Middle East, Ukraine) periodically lifted JPY on volatility spikes.  
     – Global equities have held up, but scheduled US payroll data and Fed officials’ speeches are key catalysts for risk appetite in early July.  
   d) Canadian & Japanese Data  
     – Canada: May employment surprised (net +24 k jobs vs. +15 k exp.), unemployment unchanged at 5.1%, average hourly earnings decelerated to +3.5% y/y.  
     – Japan: June core CPI eased to +2.3% y/y from +2.4%; May machine tool orders up +6.8% y/y (business capex signal). Wages remain stagnant.  

3. Technical Landscape  
   • Support cluster: 103.50 (50-day MA), then 102.80 (May low).  
   • Resistance: 104.50 (June high), then 105.00 psychological.  
   • Momentum: Daily RSI ~55, modestly bullish; MACD flat-to-positive—signals range–breakout potential rather than trend exhaustion.  

4. Upcoming Catalysts & Events  
   – July 2: US ADP employment data (may provoke CAD/JPY gap ahead of July 4 U.S. markets holiday).  
   – July 3 (Asia): BoJ minutes from June meeting; potential hints on YCC tweaks or forward guidance.  
   – July 4: U.S. markets closed; thin liquidity may amplify CAD/JPY swings on minor news.  
   – July 5: Bank of Canada rate decision; look for guidance on timing of first cut.  
   – July 11–12: Federal Reserve meeting—and any shift toward rate-cut path could weaken USD/JPY and spill into CAD/JPY.  

5. Trading Implications & Risk Management  
   • Tactical Longs: Lean CAD/JPY long on dips toward 103.50 with stops below 103.00, targeting 104.50–105.00 zone, conditional on oil > $75/bbl and BoC hawkish skew.  
   • Tactical Shorts: Use JPY rallies (geo-risk spikes or BoJ surprise) to short toward 102.80, stops above 103.40.  
   • Hedging: Consider options (strangle) to capture potential volatility around BoC decision and US payrolls.
