Here’s how I see it after weighing both sides at the desk.

What the bull got right  
• Structural yield gap: A 390-bp, two-year spread is real money in FX. Until the BoC openly signals cuts or the BoJ scraps YCC, that carry incentive is in place every single night you hold the position.  
• Oil is a tailwind more often than it’s a headwind: WTI has broken the $80 zone on tight inventories and OPEC discipline. Even if it chops, the medium-term balance-of-payments effect still favours CAD.  
• Price action above the 50-day and a rising 50-day line say the shorter-term trend is still up. A market that finds buyers ahead of the 50-day is not in free fall.  
• Positioning is not stretched. We are not walking into a massively crowded trade the way we were in late-2022.

What the bear got right  
• We are six weeks below the 200-day; that is a genuine long-term trend warning. You normally want to see two or three daily closes back above that average before declaring victory.  
• Canadian household leverage is a vulnerability. A sudden BoC shift toward easing would crush the carry story and could come out of nowhere via forward-guidance tweaks.  
• Volatility erupts when JPY safe-haven bids appear. The entire 4 % carry you earn in a year can disappear in a single 2-% candle if global risk aversion spikes.

Why the bull side still wins for me  
1. Policy timing: The BoC may eventually ease, but the earliest realistic window is late-Q1 2025. The BoJ, in contrast, has repeatedly shown that a genuine tightening cycle is still a 2026 discussion. That leaves at least two to three quarters in which the current 4 % carry remains intact.  
2. Risk-reward at current levels: Buying 104.50/105.00 with a stop under 103.50 risks roughly 100 pips. First resistance at the 200-day (106.60) gives ~160 pips; the bigger target at 107.50/108.00 gives 250-300 pips. With positive carry as a cushion, the expectancy is attractive.  
3. Catalysts skew favourable in the near term: The July 5 BoC meeting is unlikely to surprise dovishly given sticky Canadian core CPI. A mildly hawkish tone plus oil above $80 means a move back to the 200-day could materialise quickly.

My recommendation: BUY (go long CAD/JPY)

Detailed investment plan

1. Trade construction  
   • Entry zone: 104.50–105.00 (around the rising 50-day SMA).  
   • Position size: 1 % of portfolio NAV per 100-pip stop — small enough to survive a risk-off spike, large enough to benefit from carry.  
   • Stop-loss: 103.45 (just below the April/May swing low and >1 ATR from entry).  
   • Take-profit levels:  
        – TP1: 106.60 (200-day SMA); move stop to breakeven once hit.  
        – TP2: 107.80 (April high/upper channel).  
   • Time-horizon: 4–8 weeks, reassess after BoC July meeting and mid-July Fed speak.  
   • Optional structure for lower-risk traders: 3-month 105 CAD/JPY call financed by selling a 110 call — limits downside to premium, keeps the carry via option pricing.

2. Risk controls & hedges  
   • News filter: Flat or reduce to half-size 24 h ahead of U.S. payrolls or any scheduled BoJ/YCC announcement.  
   • Volatility trigger: If daily ATR spikes above 1.6 yen, tighten stop to 0.8 ATR to protect against disorderly unwind — a lesson learned from past “calm-then-storm” episodes.  
   • Cross-hedge: Hold a small long-dated USD/JPY 150 put as downside insurance; it pays off if a panic JPY rally erupts.

3. Contingency plan  
   • Close the position on a daily close below 103.50 — that would confirm the bear-flag view and save capital for a re-entry lower.  
   • Flip neutral (or even short) only if we get both: (a) BoC language that openly discusses 2024 cuts, and (b) oil back under $72. Those two together would erase the structural bull thesis.

Lessons folded in from past mistakes  
– No “breakout-chasing” this time; we wait for the dip to the 50-day zone.  
– Risk is pre-defined; ATR expansion automatically tightens stops.  
– We keep sizing modest; carry is nice, but it cannot rescue outsized leverage during a JPY flash rally.

Bottom line  
The bear arguments remind us this is not a “set-and-forget” position, but the structural carry, commodity backdrop and still-positive short- and medium-term price action tip the scale toward a tactical long. Execute patiently, respect the 103.50 fail-safe, and let the carry plus a probable retest of the 200-day do the work.
