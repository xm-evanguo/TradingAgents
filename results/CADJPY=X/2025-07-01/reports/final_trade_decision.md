RECOMMENDATION: BUY  (go long CAD/JPY), with a staggered-entry, option-hedged structure that incorporates the Neutral analyst’s timing rules and the Safe analyst’s event-risk cautions.

HOW I REACHED THE DECISION
————————————————————
1.  Key Bull Points (Risky)
   • “A ⁓550 bp BoC–BoJ rate gap is paid to you every night.”  
   • “WTI back above $80 historically lifts CAD by 3–4 % against JPY.”  
   • “Price is still holding a rising 50-day SMA; that’s where we want to buy, not chase.”

2.  Key Bear Points (Safe)
   • “Six straight weeks below a down-sloping 200-day SMA = primary trend still bearish.”  
   • “MACD histogram has slipped negative; momentum confirmation is missing.”  
   • “Carry trades implode on one-off JPY safe-haven spikes; BoC/Fed/BoJ meetings sit right in the holding window.”

3.  Middle-Road Nuances (Neutral)
   • “Wait for a bounce off the 50-day **and** a reclaim of short-term momentum (10-EMA + MACD > 0) before the first leg.”  
   • “Add size only after 105.50–105.60 breaks; trail stops with ATR.”  
   • “Partial USD/JPY put hedge neutralises a sudden yen surge without killing carry.”

4.  Why BUY Still Wins
   • Carry + commodities = a structural edge the bear case cannot replicate. Even if spot drifts sideways for three weeks, the running yield still adds just over 0.25 % to P&L.  
   • Risk/Reward math remains favourable: risking ~0.7 % to make 1.5–3 % on the chart, plus carry.  
   • The bear’s main weapon is the 200-day SMA. That is resistance, not a veto. A carefully timed entry that limits downside to the 50-day region lets us test that ceiling with acceptable risk.  
   • Option insurance and pre-event trimming explicitly neutralise the flash-gap scenario Safe Analyst fears.

REFINED TRADE PLAN (incorporates past mistakes & debate insights)
————————————————————
A.  Trade Construction  
   • Position size cap: 0.8 % NAV total, split in two 0.4 % tranches.  
   • Entry Leg 1:  
        – Conditions: Spot touches 50-day SMA (≈ 104.70) **and** MACD histogram turns back positive on a 4-hour close **and** price re-closes above 10-EMA.  
        – Execution zone: 104.70 – 104.95.  
   • Entry Leg 2:  
        – Trigger: Daily close above 105.60 (break of June down-trend line) **while WTI > $78** and VIX < 20.  
   • Stop-loss logic:  
        – Initial hard stop 75 pips below respective entry (≈ 0.8 × ATR).  
        – If daily close < 50-day SMA, cut entire position; do not wait for 103.50.  
        – ATR spike > 1.6 yen → tighten stop to 0.8 × new ATR.  
   • Profit map:  
        – TP1: 105.90–106.00 (locks a 1 : 1 on Leg 1, move stop to breakeven).  
        – TP2: 106.60 (200-day SMA). Trail stop to +40 pips.  
        – TP3: 107.80 (April high). Target exit of final ⅓ size.  
   • Time-horizon: 4–8 weeks; mandatory reassessment after BoC 5 July and Fed minutes 17 July.

B.  Hedging & Event Risk  
   • Buy a 1-month 150-strike USD/JPY put, notionally covering 25 % of CAD/JPY exposure, financed with 110 CAD/JPY OTM call sale if premium neutral.  
   • 24 h before each of: BoC (5 July), U.S. payrolls (5 July), BoJ/YCC speeches (mid-July), cut live spot exposure by 50 %.  
   • No new adds inside U.S. Independence Day liquidity gap (3–4 July).

C.  Lessons Rolled In  
   • No “all-in on first touch” — spaced entries fix last year’s error of loading size into fading momentum.  
   • ATR-based trailing stops protect against volatility regime shifts, a weakness identified in prior trades.  
   • Defined option hedge replaces vague “small USD/JPY put,” correcting the under-hedging noted by the Safe analyst.

BOTTOM LINE
————————————————————
The trade remains attractive because the **structural yield gap and commodity tail-wind are intact**, yet the revised plan respects every concrete risk the Safe analyst listed:

• If momentum never confirms, Leg 1 never triggers — capital is preserved (built-in HOLD filter).  
• If momentum confirms but the 50-day fails, the loss is capped at ~0.3 % NAV, not 1 %.  
• If a JPY shock erupts, the USD/JPY put cushions the worst.  

Therefore the decisive, risk-controlled action is **to BUY CAD/JPY on a momentum-confirmed dip**, not to sit idle (Hold) or fade the carry (Sell).
