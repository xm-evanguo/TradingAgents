Below is a continuation of the broader fundamental “deep dive” into CAD/JPY—focusing on macro data releases, policy outlooks, cross-border trade and current‐account balances, commodity exposures, fiscal positions and market‐sentiment drivers. This should round out your view of the key drivers behind the pair and help inform trading ideas.

1. Macroeconomic Growth  
   • Canada  
     – Q1 2025 GDP rose 2.1% annualized (vs. 1.8% prior), led by consumer spending and housing.  
     – Manufacturing output up 1.4% y/y, services up 2.3%.  
     – High household debt ratio (178% of disposable income) limits further consumption.  
   • Japan  
     – Q1 2025 GDP contracted –0.3% annualized (–0.1% q/q), weighed by sluggish capex and weak exports.  
     – Domestic consumption is only modestly recovering despite ongoing fiscal support.  
     – Corporate CAPEX intentions remain muted amid global uncertainty.

2. Inflation and Labor Markets  
   • Canada  
     – May CPI 2.8% y/y (core 2.4%), down from March’s 3.2%.  
     – Unemployment steady at 5.1%; wage growth at 4.0% y/y—still too hot for ease.  
   • Japan  
     – May CPI +2.7% y/y (core +2.4%). Food price spikes (rice, dairy) fueling above-target inflation.  
     – Unemployment stable at 2.5%. Wage gains at just 1.1% y/y—insufficient to entrench inflation.

3. Trade Balances & Current Accounts  
   • Canada typically runs a modest current‐account deficit (~–0.5% GDP) when oil prices are low, but flips to surplus when crude > USD 80/bbl.  
   • Japan posts a current‐account surplus (~1.2% GDP) driven by services and investment income, though the surplus has narrowed as energy imports weigh on the trade balance.  

4. Commodity Exposures  
   • CAD is highly correlated with crude oil (R²≈0.65 over last year). Oil revenues underpin Canada’s fiscal health; any disruption in OPEC+ or U.S. shale output affects CAD funding costs.  
   • JPY sees some commodity-import advantage when oil prices spike, but remains fundamentally driven by yield differentials and safe-haven flows.

5. Fiscal & Debt Profiles  
   • Canada’s federal debt / GDP ~47%, with narrow deficits forecast for 2025–26 given conservative revenue outlook. Provincial debt adds ~30% of GDP.  
   • Japan’s gross public debt ~260% of GDP, among the world’s highest; persistent fiscal stimulus and demographic headwinds limit room for long-term tightening.

6. Interest Rate Differential & FX Forward Curve  
   • Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS): Canada 2-year 4.10%, Japan 2-year 0.20% → ~3.90% differential implies a carry benefit to CAD.  
   • The 1-year forward market prices slight JPY depreciation (–0.5%) as traders roll carry.

7. Central Bank Outlook  
   • BOC: Likely on hold through Q3 2025; hawkish bias if wage data remain sticky. Cuts are only priced in for H1 2026.  
   • BOJ: Stuck in “yield curve control”—any tweaking of band width or step-in buying will be telegraphed well ahead. A first modest hike is possible if core inflation holds > 2.5% into Q4.

8. Market Sentiment & Positioning  
   • Net speculative futures: Slight short JPY, long CAD.  
   • Risk‐off episodes see JPY outperform as a primary safe-haven; CAD underperforms in global growth scares.

9. Geopolitical / Trade Risk  
   • U.S. tariff threats on autos and aluminum weigh on both economies (Canada directly, Japan via auto exports). Escalation → risk‐off, JPY up.  
   • China’s slowdown: Negative for Canadian commodity exports; neutral to mildly negative for Japan (diversified export base).

Summary & Trading Implications  
– In stable (carry‐positive) conditions with steady commodity prices, CAD/JPY should find support around 98.50–99.00, reflecting the ~3.9% yield pick-up.  
– A renewed global growth scare or U.S.–China/Canada trade flare-up could trigger a JPY‐safe-haven bid, driving CAD/JPY down toward 96.00.  
– Watch May/June Canadian wage and inflation prints for clues on BOC tightening bias; watch July BOJ forecasts for any hint on yield-curve control adjustments.
