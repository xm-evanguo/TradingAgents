## Macroeconomic Overview (June 22-29, 2025)

### Global Economy & Trade
- The World Bank revised global growth forecasts downward to 2.3% for 2025, citing ongoing trade tensions and policy uncertainty, representing the slowest growth pace outside a recession since the 2008 crisis.
- Global trade growth has slowed sharply to 1.6% in 2025 compared to 3.3% in 2024, impacted by falling commodity prices and rising protectionism.
- Persistent geopolitical risks, notably escalating tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran, have added uncertainty. Iran's threat to block the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt oil supply chains, likely contributing to recent oil price volatility.

### Geopolitical & Policy Factors
- The 2025 NATO summit focused heavily on defense budgets and security, potentially influencing global economic sentiment.
- Central banks exhibit caution: the Bank of England is being urged to moderate its quantitative tightening to ease borrowing cost pressures. The potential impact of interest rate moves globally remains a key theme.

### Market Dynamics
- U.S. stock markets, especially tech-heavy indices, show strong resilience and growth despite global headwinds.
- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have rebounded robustly since April, supported by a weaker U.S. dollar and hopes for rate cuts.
- Oil prices experienced a surge (+7%) due to Middle East tensions, highlighting ongoing risks to energy markets.
