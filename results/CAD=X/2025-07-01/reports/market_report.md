Detailed Analysis:
Short-Term Trend (10 EMA vs. Price):
• The 10-day EMA on 30 June stood at ~1.3688, below the current spot (~1.37), signaling a weak short-term bias.
• From early June highs (~1.3816 on 2 June), the 10 EMA has steadily declined—reflecting recent USD weakness against CAD.
• The slight uptick in the last few sessions suggests a tentative short-covering relief rally rather than a sustained reversal.

Medium-Term Trend (50 SMA):
• The 50-day SMA sits near ~1.3785, above both price and the 10 EMA—acting as resistance.
• Since mid-May the 50 SMA has trended lower (from ~1.3985 to current ~1.3785), confirming a medium-term downtrend.
• Price remains range-bound between the 50 SMA (resistance) and the recent lows (~1.36 support).

Long-Term Trend (200 SMA):
• The 200-day SMA remains near ~1.4038 and is slowly drifting lower—reflecting an overall long-term USD downtrend against CAD.
• Price is well below the 200-day SMA, reinforcing the bearish structural bias and discouraging aggressive long-term longs.

Momentum (MACD & Histogram):
• MACD line: peaked near –0.0059 on 20 June and has since risen to ~–0.0033, indicating that bearish momentum is waning.
• MACD Signal cross occurred in mid-June, with the MACD histogram turning positive (~+0.00115 on 30 June). This is the first bullish‐momentum sign in weeks.
• However, both readings remain in marginal territory (near zero), suggesting only a shallow relief rather than strong new trend.

Oscillator (RSI):
• The 14-day RSI is roughly 44.65 on 30 June—neutral territory.
• It dipped to an oversold ~28.4 on 17 June before rebounding into the 45–50 band.
• No overbought/oversold extremes currently—reinforcing the sense of consolidation.

Volatility (ATR):
• ATR has contracted from ~0.0095 in early June to ~0.0076 now.
• Lower volatility tends to accompany range-bound markets; breakouts should see ATR expand beyond these levels (~0.0085+).

Trading Insight:
• Overall bearish bias remains intact (price <50 & <200 SMAs). The mid-June MACD histogram flip and RSI rebound signal a short-term consolidation/relief off oversold levels.
• A retest of the 50 SMA (~1.3785) would be an attractive area to look for fresh short entries, using ATR (~0.0076) to size stops just above recent peaks.
• Continued weakness below 1.36 would project a renewed leg lower toward the next technical support zone (~1.3500).
• Conversely, a convincing break and hold above 50 SMA + MACD crossover into positive territory (~>+0.002) could signal a deeper corrective rally toward the 200 SMA.
