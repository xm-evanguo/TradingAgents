Selected Indicators:
1. close_10_ema (10-day EMA): Captures the most recent momentum shifts and helps identify turning points.  
2. close_50_sma (50-day SMA): Defines the medium-term trend and serves as dynamic support/resistance.  
3. close_200_sma (200-day SMA): Confirms the long-term trend and highlights strategic levels (golden/death cross context).  
4. macd (MACD line): Measures momentum through EMA differences; signals trend changes on crossovers.  
5. macdh (MACD histogram): Visualizes the strength of momentum and early divergence clues.  
6. rsi (14-day RSI): Flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential turning points via divergence.  
7. boll_ub (Bollinger upper band): Marks breakout/overbought zones relative to the 20-day SMA basis.  
8. atr (14-day ATR): Gauges current volatility for setting stops and sizing positions.

Rationale: Together they cover short-, medium-, and long-term trend (10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA), momentum (MACD, MACD Histogram), condition extremes (RSI, Bollinger Upper Band), and volatility (ATR). This non-redundant mix offers a balanced view—trend direction, strength, exhaustion, and risk.

Detailed Analysis for WDAY (As of June 27, 2025 close):

Trend Structure
• Short-term downtrend: The 10-day EMA has fallen from ~260 in early June to ~239.65, crossing steadily below the 50-day SMA since mid-June—bearish alignment.  
• Medium-term rollover: The 50-day SMA peaked around 244 mid-June, has flattened and edged down to ~247.46. Price trading below it confirms a shift from uptrend to neutral/bearish.  
• Long-term drag: The 200-day SMA sits at ~251.24 and has begun a slight drift lower from ~252 in late May, indicating the long-term uptrend is stalling and vulnerable to reversal.

Momentum Readings
• MACD line peaked above +10 in May, then collapsed through its signal line in early June and continues deep into negative territory (–4.03). A sustained bearish MACD crossover since mid-June.  
• MACD Histogram corroborates weakening momentum: peaked at +3.6 in mid-May, turned negative in early June, and now sits around –1.13, signaling accelerating downside momentum.

Condition/Oversold Signals
• RSI has declined from the low-50s in early June to ~40.6. While not oversold (<30), it shows loss of buying pressure. Recent lower lows in price (237.21 on June 26) accompanied by RSI ~34.95 hint at a mild oversold bounce potential.  
• Price is trading near the lower Bollinger Band (middle band ≈243; upper band ≈258; lower band ≈227), reinforcing the oversold region. However, in a downtrend prices can “ride” the lower band, so caution is warranted.

Volatility Context
• ATR peaked above 8.4 in early May, then declined to ~5.62 by June 27. Volatility has eased but remains above transitional levels. Stops sized at 1×ATR (~$6) could adapt to the current volatility regime.

Integration & Trading Implications
• The alignment of a falling 10 EMA beneath the 50 SMA and both below the 200 SMA defines a bearish regime.  
• MACD’s negative crossover and widening negative histogram confirm downward momentum.  
• RSI near 35–40 and price hugging the lower Bollinger Band suggest a potential short-term relief rally, but the macro trend remains down.  
• ATR indicates stops in the $5–6 range; position sizes should reflect this volatility.
