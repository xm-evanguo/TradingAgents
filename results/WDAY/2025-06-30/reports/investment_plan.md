Alright team, here’s the quick-take:

Key Bull Points  
• 90 %+ subscription mix growing 17 %; deferred revenue up 22 % gives unusually clear forward visibility.  
• 97 % renewal rate and net-cash balance sheet ($2.6 B) = low fundamental risk.  
• Early AI modules are showing hard ROI and can be upsold to 4,000+ installed customers; margin expansion already underway.  
• Stock is pressing the lower Bollinger Band after a 20 % pullback—historically a launch-pad in this name.

Key Bear Points  
• Growth has ticked down from 18 % to 17 %; if it slips to low-teens the multiple could compress.  
• Macro IT budgets are wobbling and Oracle/SAP are bundling aggressively.  
• 10-, 50- and 200-day averages are in bearish alignment; MACD and RSI have not yet hit washed-out levels.  
• Ongoing bias lawsuits could chill new HCM deals; no insider buying.  
• Valuation claimed at 24× EV/S and 80× P/E—“no margin of safety.”

Reality Check on the Valuation Argument  
At today’s price (~$235) Workday’s EV/S is closer to 9–10×, not 24×.  That weakens the Bear’s single biggest fundamental point.  The legal actions are real but typically settle for fractions of annual FCF; they are unlikely to impair the franchise.

Decision – BUY  
The Bear’s technical set-up is credible, but once his valuation premise is corrected the risk/reward flips: a high-retention, net-cash SaaS leader growing mid-teens with visible margin expansion normally trades on 10–12× sales.  We’re already near the low end of that range after a 20 % draw-down.  Add the latent AI upsell and a likely Fed-easing backdrop, and odds favor upside over further multiple compression.

Investment Plan

1. Position Size  
Target a 3 % core weight in a diversified growth sleeve.

2. Entry Tactics  
• Buy one-third now (≈ $235).  
• Set limit orders for the next third at $225 (2-ATR support) and the final third at $215 should the bear case play out.  
Average cost objective: $225–$230.

3. Risk Control  
• Initial stop on the first slice at $205 (close below 200-day + prior swing low).  
• Trailing stop moves to just under 50-day SMA once price closes above $250.

4. Optional Overlay  
Sell the January $200 puts for ~$6 to get paid while waiting for a deeper pull-back; use premium to partially fund protective March $210 puts after full size is reached.

5. Time Horizon & Exit  
• Fundamental thesis: 12–18 months.  
• Trim 25 % of the stake at $275 (historical resistance / 18× forward sales).  
• Re-evaluate at $300 or if growth drops below 14 %.

Past-Mistake Safeguards  
• No “one-price” entry—laddered buys cure my past tendency to go all-in at the first perceived bottom.  
• ATR-based stops prevent me from getting blown out in a macro panic (lesson from earlier SaaS whipsaws).  
• Regularly audit growth and margin progression; if two consecutive quarters show <15 % subscription growth, cut the position—don’t argue with the data.

Bottom line: the Bear is right that Workday is not cheap and that short-term momentum is weak, but once the valuation math is cleaned up the downside looks limited to the low-$200s, while a resumption of steady 17 % growth and AI upsell points to $275–$300.  That’s an asymmetry worth taking.
