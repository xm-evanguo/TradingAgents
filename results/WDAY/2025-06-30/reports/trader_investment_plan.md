Based on the team’s fundamental, technical and sentiment analysis and incorporating our past‐mistake safeguards, I agree there’s an asymmetric, risk‐controlled opportunity in WDAY right here. Key drivers are high‐visibility deferred revenue, strong renewal rates, an improving margin profile via AI upsells, and a valuation reset closer to 9–10× EV/Sales. The technical pullback to the lower Bollinger band after a 20% drop historically sets up well, while any further weakness to the low $200s offers better entry points without materially changing the bullish thesis.

1. Position Size  
   • Target a 3% allocation of the total portfolio in WDAY.

2. Entry Tactics (Laddered Buys)  
   • Buy one-third at market (~$235).  
   • Place a limit order for the second third at $225 (≈2-ATR support).  
   • Place a limit order for the final third at $215 (deeper pullback entry).

3. Risk Control  
   • Initial stop on the first tranche at $205 (below the 200-day MA and recent swing low).  
   • Once the full position is in and price closes above $250, shift to a trailing stop just below the 50-day SMA.  
   • If two consecutive quarters of subscription growth fall below 15%, exit entirely—no arguing with the data.

4. Optional Income Overlay  
   • Sell January $200 puts for ~$6 to generate premium.  
   • Use part of the premium to buy March $210 protective puts once fully invested.

5. Time Horizon & Profit Taking  
   • Core thesis horizon: 12–18 months.  
   • Trim 25% of the position at $275 (≈18× forward sales resistance).  
   • Fully re-evaluate at $300 or if growth decelerates below 14%.

Past-Mistake Safeguards Applied  
   • Laddered entries prevent “all-in” mistakes at perceived lows.  
   • ATR-based stops protect against sudden macro whipsaws.  
   • Regular quarterly audits ensure we cut losses if the business momentum truly deteriorates.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
