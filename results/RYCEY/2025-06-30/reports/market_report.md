1. **50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:

2. **200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:
   - The 200-Day SMA reads **8.6486** as of June 27.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   - The RSI levels were recorded at **78.55** on June 27, indicating that RYCEY is in overbought territory (above 70).

5. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
