Analysis Summary  
After weighing both scenarios, the Bear case has a higher probability of playing out. Core‐services inflation remains sticky, fiscal deficits are contributing to structural supply pressure, and technicals have yet to confirm a sustainable rally above the 200-day SMA. Meanwhile, the Bull requires a precise sequence of Fed cuts, a tariff ceasefire, and clean technical breakouts—too many moving parts for a reliable upside.

Key Points  
1. Macro Headwind: Sticky inflation and record Treasury issuance suggest higher‐for-longer rates.  
2. Technical Resistance: Multiple failures at the falling 200-day SMA and waning MACD momentum.  
3. Opportunity Cost: 5.5% in front‐end T-bills vs. sub-5% in TLT plus ~16 years of duration risk.  
4. Risk/Reward Skew: –15% drawdown on a 100-bp adverse move vs. +5–7% upside in a narrow Fed-cuts scenario.  
5. Past Lesson: Avoid “hold” paralysis—force a stance and redeploy capital into better risk-adjusted outlets.

Recommended Action Plan  
1. SELL / Underweight TLT  
   • Target exit: 87.50–88.50 (slippage ≤3 bp).  
2. Reallocate Proceeds  
   • 60% into a 1–3-month T-bill ladder (≈5.4–5.5%).  
   • 30% into a 2-year Treasury ETF (e.g., SHY; ≈4.9%, modest roll-down).  
   • 10% into Dec-24 $90 TLT calls as a low-cost convexity kicker (<0.5% portfolio).  
3. Risk Controls & Review Triggers  
   • Reassess if 10-yr yields close <3.75% for two weeks AND TLT closes above a flattening 200-day SMA.  
   • Review post-FOMC and upon substantive tariff headlines.  
4. Tax & Position Sizing  
   • Coordinate loss harvesting with a tax adviser.  
   • Keep duration exposure below four years (vs. >15 years long).  

By taking a clear stance now and redeploying into higher-yield, lower-volatility instruments, we avoid past hold-induced drawdowns and seize better opportunity cost.  

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
