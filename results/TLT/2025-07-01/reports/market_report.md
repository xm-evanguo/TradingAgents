Detailed Analysis  

1. Price vs. Moving Averages  
   • 10 EMA (87.23) > 50 SMA (86.43): Short-term momentum turned positive in mid-June after a pullback into the 50 SMA. TLT has trended up from early June lows (≈86.50) into the upper 80s.  
   • Price (88.25 on 6/30) is above 50 SMA but still below 200 SMA (88.73), indicating a medium-term bullish bounce within a longer-term downtrend.  
   • 200 SMA remains bearish-sloping since late April, reflecting the post-March sell-off.  

2. Momentum Conditions (RSI, MACD, MACD Histogram)  
   • RSI ≈61: Neither overbought nor oversold; confirms controlled upside momentum without extreme readings.  
   • MACD line has crossed into positive territory (0.44) for the first time since February, signaling a potential trend reversal if sustained.  
   • MACD histogram positive and expanding (≈0.24), suggesting building bullish momentum—but the curve is flattening over the last few days, so watch for divergence.  

3. Volatility Context (Bollinger Upper Band, ATR)  
   • Price is brushing the Upper Bollinger Band (~88.34), which often precedes consolidation or a mild pullback unless there’s a strong breakout catalyst.  
   • ATR (~0.97) has contracted from mid-May highs (≈1.25), indicating reduced volatility; this consolidation phase often precedes the next directional move.  

Trading Insights  
- A sustained break above the 200 SMA (~88.73) with rising MACD and RSI above 70 would confirm a medium-term trend shift toward higher yields/risk-off positioning.  
- Failure to hold above the 50 SMA (≈86.43) on a daily close could signal a resumption of the longer-term downtrend, targeting previous lows near 85.50.  
- Use ATR (~0.97) to set initial stops (~1 ATR below support or EMA), and monitor whether price rides the upper Bollinger Band on expanding volume as confirmation of a genuine breakout.
