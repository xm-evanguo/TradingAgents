Detailed Technical Analysis Report for GOOG from May 2024 to June 2025

1. Moving Averages:
   - 50-day SMA (Medium-term trend): As of late June 2025, the 50-day SMA is around 167.0. The price generally hovers near or above this level recently, indicating a moderately positive medium-term trend. The 50 SMA is useful for dynamic support, and prices found support around this level multiple times in June.
   - 200-day SMA (Long-term trend): The 200-day SMA is around 173.4 by late June 2025. The price was mostly below this level in June, suggesting some weakness relative to the long-term average, signaling a possible consolidation or correction phase in the long-term trend. However, the price movements show attempts to close the gap toward the 200 SMA.
   - 10-day EMA (Short-term trend): The 10-day EMA is quite responsive with values fluctuating in the high 160s to mid-170s recently, matching quick momentum shifts. Crossings above or below the 10 EMA would give short-term entries or exit signals in conjunction with other indicators.

2. MACD:
   - The MACD line in late June 2025 remains positive (~1.44 on 6/27/25) but shows a decreasing trend compared to early June (above 3.5). This suggests momentum is waning but still bullish on a momentum basis.
   - The MACD Histogram, which reflects momentum strength, was negative at the end of June (-0.38), indicating some bearish divergence or weakening momentum despite the MACD line remaining positive. This can signal caution as momentum may be fading or a potential trend reversal or pullback coming.

3. RSI (Relative Strength Index):
   - The RSI values have recently dropped from mid-60s in early June 2025 to about 59.7 by June 27, suggesting a move away from overbought conditions but still in moderately bullish momentum territory (above 50). 
   - RSI near 60 indicates some strength but not an extreme. The absence of overbought signals (above 70) signals a healthy consolidation or steadying in price rather than an immediate reversal.

4. ATR (Average True Range):
   - ATR is hovering around 4.6 to 4.7 recently, indicating modest volatility. This level suggests that price swings are moderate, allowing for reasonable stop-loss placement and risk control.
   - Volatility levels are steady, not overly high, which helps in avoiding knee-jerk market reactions but still shows the presence of price movement suitable for active trading.

5. VWMA (Volume Weighted Moving Average):
   - The VWMA is around 174, slightly above the current price levels in late June 2025. The VWMA integrates volume confirming that heavier traded prices are at higher levels than the current price, suggesting potential resistance to upward price action or that recent volume-supported levels were slightly higher.
   - A downward price divergence below VWMA indicates sellers have been more active at slightly higher prices, suggesting a cautious stance by buyers.

Summary of Market Context and Indicator Insights:
- The medium-term (50 SMA) is below the long-term benchmark (200 SMA), and price is slightly below the 200 SMA, indicating a mixed to slightly bearish longer-term environment.
- Short-term momentum (MACD) is positive but weakening, with MACD Histogram showing signs of fading momentum.
- RSI indicates no extreme overbought/oversold conditions, suggesting consolidation rather than a strong directional move.
- ATR shows moderate volatility, suitable for measured risk-taking.
- VWMA indicates recent higher-volume trades at prices slightly above current levels, hinting resistance or distribution.

Overall, GOOG appears to be in a cautious consolidation phase with signs of weakening short-term momentum, trading near medium-term support levels. Traders should watch for a confirmed break above 200 SMA and rising MACD momentum for a bullish resumption or a break below the 50 SMA support with increasing ATR and negative MACD Histogram for potential short-term bearish opportunities.
