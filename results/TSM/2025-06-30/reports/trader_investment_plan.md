Based on the detailed analysis provided, the investment plan for TSM appears strong and grounded in various supportive factors that favor a buying decision. Specifically, the following elements are compelling:

1. **Structural Growth Drivers:** TSMC's dominant position in advanced-node capacity amid high demand driven by AI, automotive, and 5G markets suggests a robust growth trajectory. Owning over 55% of the advanced-node capacity solidifies its market share and pricing leverage.

2. **Technological Leadership:** TSMC’s advancements, particularly with its 3-nm and upcoming 2-nm processes, provide it with a critical edge over competitors like Samsung and Intel, who are struggling to catch up in terms of yield and technology.

3. **Valuation Metrics:** The current valuation relative to its growth potential and the S&P 500 indicates that TSMC is reasonably priced, further supporting the argument for buying.

4. **Technical Indicators:** Positive technical signals, such as price positioning relative to moving averages and a past “overbought” RSI that has historically persisted in uptrends, suggest a favorable trading environment.

5. **Geopolitical Risk Management:** The proactive steps to diversify production and lessen geopolitical risks, combined with a defined risk management strategy including stop-loss orders and hedging, alleviate concerns around potential market volatility.

The bearish arguments are valid, particularly regarding cyclicality and geopolitical risks; however, the overall structural demand and TSMC's efforts to manage risks and position itself strategically suggest that the risks are manageable. 

In light of the past lessons learned, specifically about being decisive instead of holding without conviction, I recommend implementing the investment plan structure as proposed. This entails buying into TSMC now while strategically planning to average into the position in a disciplined manner. 

To clarify the actionable steps from the analysis:
1. Purchase the first portion of TSM stock at the current market price.
2. Set a limit order for the second tranche.
3. Prepare for a review after the upcoming earnings report.

By demonstrating strategic investment discipline and commitment to a clear bullish view, it allows for better long-term potential while mitigating risks effectively.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
