Quick recap of the debate

Bull’s strongest points  
• Structural growth: AI, HPC, 5G and automotive are all wafer-hungry and TSM owns >55 % of advanced-node capacity.  
• Technological lead: 3-nm volume is ramping, 2-nm risk-production starts 2H-25; no other foundry has that road-map locked in.  
• Blue-chip customer list (Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, AMD) secures multiyear demand visibility and pricing power.  
• Still-reasonable valuation: forward P/E mid-teens, FCF ≈ US$10 bn, net cash, dividend yield ~1.6 %.  
• Technicals confirm accumulation (price above 50/200-DMA, positive MACD); recent “overbought” RSI often persists in strong up-trends.  

Bear’s strongest points  
• Cyclicality & saturation: smartphones/PCs have slowed before; if AI hardware demand pauses, fab utilization dives and margins compress.  
• Competitive threat: Samsung and Intel are spending >US$20 bn/yr each to catch up, while governments subsidize local fabs (possible share loss).  
• Client concentration/geopolitics: Apple ≈ 25 % of revenue; 90 % of production is in Taiwan—China-US tension or a Taiwan earthquake is a non-trivial tail risk.  
• Short-term softness: May–Jun revenue dip and RSI >70 flag near-term pull-back risk; high expectations leave little room for disappointment.

Decision – Buy

Why the bull case prevails  
1. Moat and scale are real and quantifiable. TSM’s yield advantage at advanced nodes has widened, not shrunk, despite Samsung/Intel spending. Catch-up is proving harder and slower than bears assume.  
2. Structural demand > cyclical noise. AI servers (GPUs & custom accelerators) are on allocation through 2025; auto chips are booked years out. These lines run at the most advanced nodes where TSM controls supply.  
3. Valuation is not demanding. A mid-teens multiple for a quasi-monopoly on the most critical layer of the digital economy is attractive relative to the S&P 500 (≈20×) and to peers (ASML 30×, NVDA 35× forward).  
4. Geopolitical risk is the correct reason to demand a discount, but the market already applies one. Washington’s Chips Act is forcing TSM to diversify capacity (Arizona, Japan, Germany), gradually reducing single-point-of-failure risk.

Investment plan

1. Position sizing  
   • Core long allocation: 3 % of equity portfolio (adjust to risk tolerance).  
   • Build in three equal tranches to average into volatility:  
        – Tranche 1 at market (today).  
        – Tranche 2 on any 8-10 % pull-back (e.g., RSI <60 or tag of rising 50-DMA).  
        – Tranche 3 after Q3 earnings if guidance is reiterated/upgraded.

2. Risk management  
   • Stop-loss mental guide at 20 % below average cost (≈ long-term 200-DMA) to protect against a severe macro or geopolitical shock.  
   • Hedge tail risk: Buy 6-to-12-month out-of-the-money puts on FXI (China large-cap ETF) or on TSM itself equal to ~30 % of the notional long exposure; cheap insurance if Taiwan tension escalates.  

3. Time horizon & targets  
   • Base-case 18-24-month price objective: 25-30 × 2026E EPS of US$28  → US$700-800 ADR (or NT$1,200-1,350 in Taipei), ~40-55 % upside.  
   • Review thesis every two earnings cycles; upgrade/downsize if (a) Intel 18A lands Apple or NVDA, or (b) TSM slips a node on its roadmap.

4. Ongoing monitoring checklist  
   • Monthly revenue releases – look for YoY growth turning solidly positive by Q4.  
   • Capacity expansion progress in Arizona/Japan.  
   • Foundry market-share reports (TrendForce, Counterpoint) for any meaningful Samsung 3- or 2-nm wins.  
   • U.S./China-Taiwan headlines – raise hedge size if tensions spike.

Lessons applied from past mistakes  
Previously I have erred by (1) defaulting to Hold when pros/cons felt balanced and (2) entering full size at once. Here, I commit to a directional view (Buy) and spread entries, while explicitly addressing the fat-tail geopolitical risk with a defined hedge.

Actionable next steps – in plain language  
• Put the first third of your intended TSM position on today.  
• Enter a good-till-cancelled limit order 9 % below current price for the second tranche.  
• Schedule a review post-earnings; if execution remains solid, add the final tranche.  
• Buy protective puts costing no more than 1 % of position value; roll them forward semi-annually.  
Follow the checklist, stay disciplined, and let TSM’s structural moat and secular growth story work in your favor.
