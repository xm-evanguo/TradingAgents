RECOMMENDATION: BUY (phased, hedged)  

──────────────────────────────────  
1.  Key Arguments Distilled  
Risky / Bull  
• “TSMC owns >55 % of advanced-node capacity” and is already ramping 3 nm while 2 nm risk-production is locked for 2H-25—no rival can match that roadmap near-term.  
• Secular demand (AI servers, automotive, HPC) is “on allocation through 2025”; these are the very nodes only TSM supplies.  
• Valuation remains a “mid-teens forward P/E for a quasi-monopoly,” cheaper than the S&P 500 and far cheaper than tech peers.  
• Technicals: price above 50/200-DMA, positive MACD = institutional accumulation.  

Safe / Conservative  
• Chip industry is “violently cyclical”; May–June revenue dip shows the down-leg may already be starting.  
• “Apple ≈25 % of revenue; 90 % of production is in Taiwan”—China-US tension or an earthquake is a non-trivial existential tail risk.  
• Competitors are spending >US$20 bn/yr each with government subsidies; any TSM node delay opens the door to share loss.  
• RSI >70 flags overbought; profit-taking often follows.  

Neutral  
• Acknow­ledges both sides; suggests gradual entry “while closely monitoring economic indicators and TSM’s execution.”  
• Points out that high RSI does not always signal a peak, but caution is warranted.  

Where the Debate Lands  
• All three agree TSMC’s technological lead is real—only timing of possible erosion is disputed.  
• The biggest uncontested risk is geopolitics; the bull plan already proposes explicit hedging.  
• Near-term technical overextension is best handled by scaling in, not by abandoning the trade.  

2.  Why BUY Prevails  
a) Moat + Secular Tailwinds Outweigh Cyclicality  
   Foundry share, yield advantage and client lock-in give TSM a profit shield even in slowdowns. Every AI GPU or iPhone 16 still needs the company’s most advanced wafers.  
b) Valuation Already Discounts Geopolitics  
   The stock trades at a 20–30 % discount to global megacap tech despite higher gross margins and a net-cash balance sheet—implying the market is already pricing a meaningful probability of disruption.  
c) Risk Can Be Engineered Down  
   A three-tranche buy, a mental stop near the 200-DMA and inexpensive tail-risk puts directly address the Safe Analyst’s principal objections.  
d) Waiting for Total Clarity Usually Means Paying Up  
   TSM has historically run 20–30 % in the six months after prior “overbought” RSI prints during up-cycles. Hesitating for a perfect entry has a real opportunity cost.  

3.  Refined Trade Plan (builds on the original, tighter on entries & hedges)  
Position Size      : 3 % of equity portfolio (fits within a single-name cap of 5 %).  
Tranche Schedule :  
   • Tranche 1 — 0.8 % at market today (RSI 75; small toe-hold).  
   • Tranche 2 — 1.0 % if price pulls back 7–10 % OR RSI falls below 65.  
   • Tranche 3 — 1.2 % after Q3 results only if (i) 3 nm yields meet guidance and (ii) YoY monthly sales turn positive.  
Stop-Guide        : Mental stop 18 % below blended cost (just under the 200-DMA).  
Hedge              : Buy 6- to 9-month 20 %-OTM puts on TSM or FXI sized at ≈30 % notional of the long; cost cap 1 % of position per year.  
Optional Income : Sell 10 %-OTM covered calls on Tranche 1 to offset hedge cost while RSI > 70.  
Monitoring List   : Monthly sales, node-roadmap status, Arizona/Japan fab progress, U.S.–China headlines. Escalate hedge if PLA drills expand beyond median line.  

4.  Past-Mistake Guardrails  
Mistake #1: Defaulting to HOLD when pros & cons feel balanced → Here we issue a decisive BUY, backed by explicit downside controls.  
Mistake #2: Entering full size at once → Phased buys with objective technical triggers.  
Mistake #3: Ignoring fat-tail risk → Dedicated geopolitical hedge in place from day one.  

5.  Next 24-Hours Action Checklist (plain English)  
□ Place market order for first 0.8 % position.  
□ Enter GTC limit 9 % below current price for Tranche 2.  
□ Price 9-month 20 %-OTM puts; spend ≤1 % of the cash outlay.  
□ Log calendar reminders for TSM monthly sales release and Q3 earnings date.  

Bottom Line: The structural growth runway, durable moat and still-reasonable valuation justify owning TSMC now. Execute with discipline, hedge the obvious tail risk, and let the secular AI and advanced-node wave do the heavy lifting.
